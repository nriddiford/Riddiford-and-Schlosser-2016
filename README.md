# Data access


### Experimental setup

To identify presumptive direct targets of Six1 and Eya1, Six1-GR and Eya1-GR fusion proteins were overexpressed either alone or together in the PPE. In combination with a protein synthesis inhibitor (CHX), nuclear translocation of Six1 and Eya1 was induced by adding DEX for 2.5 hr, and gene expression was analysed using RNA-Seq. Presumptive direct targets of Six1 and Eya1 were determined by comparing Six1-GR-, Eya1-GR- or Six1-GR+Eya1-GR-injected embryos treated with CHX alone (as controls) against CHX+DEX-treated samples.

# Trimming and mapping 

 
### Run Fastqc to visually inspect all sequencing results

```fastqc -i <input> -o <output_dir>```

### Run Trimmomatic to quality-filter reads

```{java}
java -classpath /path/to/Trimmomatic/trimmomatic-0.25.jar org.usadellab.trimmomatic.TrimmomaticPE
-threads 12 \
-phred33 \
<pe_1> <pe_2> <paired_output_1> <unpaired_output_1> <paired_output_2> <unpaired_output_2> \
ILLUMINACLIP:<filter_set> \
LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 HEADCROP:12 MINLEN:36
```
`filter_set` contains list of primer sequences to exclude


### Build Bowtie index

```
bowtie2-build <genome.fasta>
```

Run in same directory as `genome.fasta` file. For this analysis we used *X.laevis* genome version [Xl7](http://www.xenbase.org/other/static/ftpDatafiles.jsp)


### Run Tophat2 on each set of paired reads

``` tophat2 -p 12 -r 250 -N 3 -o <ouput_dir> <bowtie-index> <paired_output_1> <paired_output_2>```

Get stats for run and rename .bam file:
 
```samtools flagstat accepted_hits.bam > stats.txt```  
```mv accepted_hits.bam <condition.rep.bam>```  


# Transcript assembly and differential expression analysis


### Assemble transcripts and calcuulate abundance estimation with Cufflinks

```cufflinks -p 12 -b <bowtie-index> -o <ouput_dir> <condition.rep.bam>```


### Merge assemblies using Cuffmerge

```ls -1 <path/to/cufflinks_output_condition_1/transcripts.gtf> <condition_n/transcripts.gtf> > assemblies.txt ```  
```cuffmerge assemblies.txt```


### Differential expression using Cuffdiff

```
cd <cufflinks_output_dir> \
cuffdiff -p 12 \
-o <cufflinks_output_dir/diff_out> \
-b <bowtie-index/.fasta> \
-L <L1,L2> <merged.gtf> <L1_rep1.bam>,<L1_rep2.bam> <L2_rep1.bam>,<L2_rep2.bam>
````


# Estimating variance between biological replicates

```perl pearsons.pl```

Run **pearsons.pl** from same directory as Cuffdiff output file `genes.read_group_tracking`  
Output can used as input for a standard Pearson's correlation (e.g. in R)


# Annotating transcript models


### Build transcript models

To build transcript models from genome using cufflinks output, run **transcripts.pl** from same directory as `merged.gtf`

```perl transcripts.pl```

This script will read in exonic positions from cufflinks output file `merged.gtf` and relate then to genomic positions. The program outputs:  
 * All transcript variants for a given gene
 * All exons in each gene
 * The longest transcript variant for all assembled genes (numbered by transcript variant)


### Add differential expression information

Run **de.genes.pl**

```perl de.genes.pl```

This script will attach differenital expression info from the cufdiff output file `gene_exp.diff` to transcripts assembled in **transcripts.pl**


### Annotate

To annotate our transcript models, we purformed a BLAST against a combined (X. laevis and X. tropicalis) [Xenopus mRNA database](http://www.xenbase.org/other/static/ftpDatafiles.jsp)

BLAST output from **de_genes.pl** (`de_transcripts_.fa`) against Xenopus mRNA database:

```
blastn -db <path_to_Xenopus_DB> \
-query <de_transcripts_.fa> \
-num_threads 12 \ 
-evalue '0.00001' \
-perc_identity 80 \
-outfmt "6 qseqid pident sseqid" \
-task blastn \
-max_target_seqs 1 | sort -u -k1,1 > <output.txt>
```

Run **annotator.pl**

```perl annotator.pl <Xenopus blast output> <condition> <de_genes.txt>```


# Gene Enrichment Analysis

To look for gene enrichement between two conditions, run **enrichment.pl**

```perl enrichment.pl <blast.file1> <blast.file2>```

This script will read in differentially expressed genes (output from **blast.pl**) for two conditions and output the top 10% for each list, as well as input data for a Chi-squared table 

Perform chi squared test using output from **enrichment.pl** (e.g. use http://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/chisquare/)


# Find co-differentially expressed genes 


### For single conditions

Run **godzilla.pl** for blast output for multiple conditions. 
"Control" must always be listed first

Blast output must have the following, tab delimited format:  
`gene	XLOC_control.fpkm:expt.fpkm,_Change:FC_val	%id	blast hit`

```perl godzilla.pl control.txt six.txt six-eya.txt eya.txt```

This program will take N blast hit results and output those genes which are found to be overlapping in `$n` conditions.


### For merged conditions

Run **DE_sig.pl** 

"Control" must always be listed first

Blast output must have the following, tab delimited format:  
`gene	XLOC_control.fpkm:expt.fpkm,_Change:FC_val	%id	blast hit`

```perl DE_sig.pl control.txt six.txt six-eya.txt eya.txt```


# Gene Ontology analysis on discrete gene sets

Run **sets.pl** to look for common genes between different de gene sets (lists outputted from **godzilla.pl**)

```perl sets.pl list1 list2 list3```


### DAVID

Blast output (e.g. 'setA') against Human Uniprot DB

```
blastx -db <path_to_Human_UniDB> \
-query <setA.fa> \
-num_threads 12 \
-evalue '0.001' \
-outfmt "6 qseqid pident sseqid" \
-max_target_seqs 1 | sort -u -k1,1 > <output.txt>
```

Resulting output can then be used as input for [David](https://david.ncifcrf.gov)
